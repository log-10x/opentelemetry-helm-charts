[![Release Status](https://github.com/log-10x/opentelemetry-helm-charts/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/log-10x/opentelemetry-helm-charts/actions/workflows/release.yaml)

Helm charts for deploying OpenTelemetry Collector with an [10x Edge app](https://doc.log10x.com/apps/edge)

The OpenTelemetry Collector charts are built on top of the official [opentelemetry helm charts](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts), and work by deploying a Log10x sidecar alongside the collector for log optimization.

For more details on how the images are created, see the [docker-images repo](https://github.com/log-10x/docker-images).

The supported [10x distributions](https://doc.log10x.com/architecture/flavors/) are JIT Edge and Native Edge. Check out each individual chart values.yaml for full configuration options.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use these charts; please refer to the _Helm_ [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

### OCI Repository (Recommended)

Install directly from the OCI registry:

```shell
# Install opentelemetry-collector
helm install my-collector oci://ghcr.io/log-10x/opentelemetry-helm-charts/opentelemetry-collector

# Install a specific version
helm install my-collector oci://ghcr.io/log-10x/opentelemetry-helm-charts/opentelemetry-collector --version 0.2.1

# Show chart info and available versions
helm show all oci://ghcr.io/log-10x/opentelemetry-helm-charts/opentelemetry-collector
```

No `helm repo add` required - OCI pulls directly from the registry.

### Helm Repository (Alternative)

Add the Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add log10x-otel https://log-10x.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts
helm repo update
helm search repo log10x-otel
```

Then install:

```shell
helm install my-collector log10x-otel/opentelemetry-collector
```

## Log10x Integration

Enable Log10x by setting `tenx.enabled: true` in your values file:

```yaml
tenx:
  enabled: true
  apiKey: "YOUR-LICENSE-KEY"
  kind: "regulate"  # Options: report, regulate, optimize
  runtimeName: "my-otel-collector"

  # Optional: GitOps configuration
  github:
    config:
      enabled: true
      token: "YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN"
      repo: "YOUR-ORG/YOUR-CONFIG-REPO"
```

### Log10x Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `report` | Analytics-only mode - generates cost and usage metrics without modifying logs |
| `regulate` | Filtering mode - reduces log volume based on configured rules |
| `optimize` | Full optimization - reduces log volume while preserving information |
